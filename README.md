# Udacity FEND Project 5: Restaurant Reviews App STAGE 1
---
## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I was asked to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I was also asked to also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

### Specification

I had been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. I had to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Server Implementation

To view the site, open up a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

After running the server, now you can see your app live in http://localhost:8000

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:
